# Stella Dei

Stella Dei is a sandbox game about creating planet and influencing it with your unlockable divine abilities in order to create and maintain life, civilizations, and maybe help them expand beyond.

> Careful. At some point youâ€™re just playing god.

In summary, it's a space game. In a space bar. Using a space bar (unfortunately we are at regret of telling you that it doesn't actually use a space bar)

## Compiling

### Dependencies

The game requires:
- Zig master (at least `0.10.0-dev.1521+e8813b296`)
- [Zigmod](https://github.com/nektro/zigmod)

### Building from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PixelGuys/Stella-Dei && Stella-Dei
$ zigmod fetch
$ zig build
```

*Note: you need the `ocl-icd-opencl-dev` package (only for building the game)*

And now you've got an executable located inside `zig-out/bin/`. If you want to directly run the game, just do:
```
$ zig build run
```
